WHAT IS THIS
This is a collection of scripts to create, delete and check if a user exists.
My main problem was a repetitive user creation process but after scripting
that part I decided to script the view and delete functionality too.

WHY SCRIPT IT
I setup quite a no of new linux servers and most of the time I find myself
repeating the same steps each time to add users so I thought an automated
script might save me the hassle of having to type the same commands and text
every time

HOW TO USE IT
1. Append the appropriate permissions chmod u+x inception.sh
2. run ./inception.sh to apply permissions to all the other scripts
3. Add the users you want to create in bulk one per line in users.txt
3. Add the users you want to create in bulks ssh keys one per line in the same sequence
4. run ./menu.sh and follow the prompts

OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION
If you are a novice linux user using this script you can also

1. Install/enable a firewall (ufw, shorewall e.t.c) and close all unused ports
(set default action to drop or reject read more: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-choose-an-effective-firewall-policy-to-secure-your-servers)
2. Disable password and root login

  #edit the file
  vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

  #set the following

  PermitRootLogin no
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
  PasswordAuthentication no

  #reload config
  service ssh restart

3. Create a non root account and put it in a group that can sudo (this script will do that for you)
4. Allow that group to sudo

  #edit the sudoers file
  visudo

  #add the following under members who might gain root privileges

  %group-name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

This should allow the user whose public key you added to ssh into the server without being required to present a password
